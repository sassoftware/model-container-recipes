# Model Containerization - Base Image Creation - R

## Getting Started

1. Read the documentation from the parent directory and prepare the environment.

2. Generate the R base image, using the following command.

```
  $ python base_image_generation.py r
```
This should result in the following output:

```
Loading configuration properties...

```

For more information, refer to the FAQs in the Base Image Creation [README](../README.md).

## Test

You can test the generated R base image with the provided R test model. 
The test script in the test folder does the following: 
* temporarily generates a local model image from local R base image
* launches a container instance via 'docker run'
* performs scoring in the container instance
* retrieves the score results and display
* terminates the container instance
* deletes the temporary model image
    
```
  $ cd model-container-recipes
  $ cd base-image-cli/r_base/test
  $ chmod 755 test_model_image.sh
  $ ./test_model_image.sh  
```
